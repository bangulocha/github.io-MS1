        <p align="center">Hi, my name is Britney Angulo! 
        I was born on May 18, 2005 in Avondale, Arizona. I attended an elementary school named Garden Lakes and then after 8th grade I moved 
        down the street (literally) to attend Westview Highschool. While in highschool I was apart of the volleyball team, National Honors Society,
        ASU TRIO Club, and volunteered in many school events. I graduated highschool in the top 3% of my class and decided I would go to Grand
        Canyon University. Which leads me to today. I'm currently 18 years old and in my freshman year of college. My major is in Software Development, 
        as I find Web and Application Development very interesting and exciting! Some of my hobbies include reading, scrapbooking, playing volleyball, and drawing. 
        If you'd like to see more about my hobbies, you can visit my "hobbies" page where I show pictures and talk more in-depth about my hobbies!</p> <!--to do: insert anchor for hobbies page-->

     <img src="about me picture.jpg" alt="My Picture" style="float:right;width:170px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;" border="5">    <!--my picture assigned a float:right tag for proper text wrapping, photo is also given a border-->

     <p align="center">More about my personal life, I grew up with 2 sisters, one which is my twin! <!--centering the text-->
        The other is younger, we are 14 months apart. I am the oldest of the family. My parents are both Mexican, which of course makes me Mexican too. I have a really 
        huge extended family. This is because of my parent's parents, since they had a bunch of children. For example, my mom had 7 siblings. But if you think that's alot 
        wait until you find out how much siblings my dad has... okay he has 12! Yep. So yeah, you can only imagine how much aunts, uncles and cousins I have. I love it! It's 
        my biggest blessing, I couldn't imagine it any other way. I also have 3 golden retrievers. There are two girl named Olivia and Canela, and a boy named Canelo. They
        are super cute! So yes, that is a little bit about me, and if you don't want to read all of that, there is a summary below!</p>
